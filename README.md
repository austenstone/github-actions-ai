# Using AI inside GitHub Actions

This repository contains various GitHub Actions that utilize AI models to enhance your workflows. The primary focus is on using AI for code reviews, pull request comments, and other automation tasks.

All the major AI providers have GitHub Actions that allow you to use their models directly in your workflows. Here are some of the most popular ones:

- [OpenAI Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex/tree/main/.github/actions/codex)
- [Anthropic Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action)
- [Google Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli-action)

## Use Cases
